There are 2 files.
One is for hosting bus data (json_host.py)
Second one is for hosting simple map website on localhost with all neccessary data to show bus and stops locations. (bus_map.py)

both files will work as long as czynacza.pl don't change anything related to this data...

I also provide this data world-wide on my website.
